# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Canto smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between March 29 â€” April 3, 2024.

## Wardens

In Code4rena's Invitational audits, the competition is limited to a small group of wardens; for this audit, 5 wardens contributed reports:

  1. [oakcobalt](https://code4rena.com/@oakcobalt)
  2. [0xTheC0der](https://code4rena.com/@0xTheC0der)
  3. [SpicyMeatball](https://code4rena.com/@SpicyMeatball)
  4. [d3e4](https://code4rena.com/@d3e4)
  5. [0xpiken](https://code4rena.com/@0xpiken)

This audit was judged by [3docSec](https://code4rena.com/@3docsec).

Final report assembled by [thebrittfactor](https://twitter.com/brittfactorC4).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 5 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 3 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 5 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Canto repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto), and is composed of 3 smart contracts and 3 interfaces written in the Solidity programming language and includes 247 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities based on three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

For more information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), specifically our section on [Severity Categorization](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization).

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] Native gas tokens can become stuck in `ASDRouter` contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/6)
*Submitted by [0xTheC0der](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/6), also found by [SpicyMeatball](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/29) and [oakcobalt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/28)*

In case of a successful `asD` redemption flow, native gas tokens (`CANTO`) can become stuck in the `ASDRouter` contract.

A successful execution of [`lzCompose`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) ends with a call to [`_sendASD`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L130-L167):

```solidity
function _sendASD(bytes32 _guid, OftComposeMessage memory _payload, uint _amount) internal {
    /* transfer the ASD tokens to the destination receiver */
    if (_payload._dstLzEid == cantoLzEID) {
        // just transfer the ASD tokens to the destination receiver
        ...
        ASDOFT(_payload._cantoAsdAddress).transfer(_payload._dstReceiver, _amount);   // @audit 0 of msg.value used
    } else {
        // use Layer Zero oapp to send ASD tokens to the destination receiver on the destination chain

        // make sure msg.value is enough to cover the fee or this transaction will revert
        if (msg.value < _payload._feeForSend) {   // @audit msg.value >= _payload._feeForSend seems intended, otherwise != should be used
            // refund ASD tokens on canto
            _refundToken(_guid, _payload._cantoAsdAddress, _payload._cantoRefundAddress, _amount, msg.value, "insufficient msg.value for send fee");
            return;
        }

        // create send params for the Layer Zero oapp
        ...

        // send tokens
        (bool successfulSend, bytes memory data) = payable(_payload._cantoAsdAddress).call{value: _payload._feeForSend}(abi.encodeWithSelector(IOFT.send.selector, sendParams, fee, _payload._cantoRefundAddress));   // @audit only _payload._feeForSend of msg.value used

        // check if the send was successful
        if (!successfulSend) {
            // refund ASD tokens on canto
            _refundToken(_guid, _payload._cantoAsdAddress, _payload._cantoRefundAddress, _amount, msg.value, string(data));
            return;
        }
        ...
    }
    // @audit rest of msg.value is not refunded
}
```

Thereby, one can distinguish 3 scenarios:

1. On error: `msg.value` is fully refunded to specified refund address.
2. On successful transfer (within Canto chain): `0` of `msg.value` is used and any remaining value will be stuck.

*One cannot assume and the contract doesn't require that `msg.value == 0` always holds in this case.*

3. On successful transfer (to other chain): `_payload._feeForSend` of `msg.value` is used for sending `asD`, the remaining value will be stuck.

*One cannot assume and the contract doesn't require that `msg.value == _payload._feeForSend` always holds in this case.*

Furthermore, the present behaviour violates a protocol invariant, according to the [README](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/README.md?plain=1#L193):

> 1. `ASDRouter` native balance should always be zero.

### Proof of Concept

> 1. `On successful transfer (within Canto chain)` - there is no need for the user to send a non-zero msg.value in this case.
> 2. `On successful transfer (to other chain)` - since `_feeForSend` is known beforehand, sending `msg.value > _feeForSend` can be considered a mistake on user's side.

## [[H-02] Dual transaction nature of composed message transfer allows anyone to steal user funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/5)
*Submitted by [0xTheC0der](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/5), also found by [d3e4](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/24) and [oakcobalt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/16)*

Sending OFTs with a composed message via LayerZero V2 involves 2 transactions on the destination chain (Canto) according to the [documentation](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart#optional-\_composedmsg) (see also [README](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/README.md?plain=1#L199)):

1.  Receiving: The LayerZero endpoint receives the message and processes the OFT transfer to the `ASDRouter` contract.
2.  Executing: Since the message is composed, it's *permissionlessly* processed by an executor who invokes the [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) method of the `ASDRouter` contract.

The above steps are processed in separate transactions (not atomic) and step 2 requires the OFTs [to be already transferred](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/README.md?plain=1#L89) to the `ASDRouter` contract.

Furthermore, due to the permissionless nature of the execution step, the [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) method does not enforce any constraints on the `msg.sender`; therefore, allows anyone to invoke it.

**Attack path:**

An adversary can monitor the `ASDRouter` contract for [whitelisted](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L79) incoming USDC-like OFTs and immediately use those on their own (redeem `asD`) by crafting & invoking a call to [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) before an executor does. As a consequence, user funds are directly stolen.

Similarly, if [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) fails for any reason, an adversary can re-try before the user to use the OFTs.

### Proof of Concept

The dual transaction nature of the current composed message process is confirmed by the LayerZero [documentation](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart#optional-\_composedmsg):

> If the message is composed, the contract retrieves and re-encodes the additional composed message information, then delivers the message to the endpoint, which will execute the additional logic as a separate transaction.

Moreover, crafting a successful call to [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) once OFTs are deposited is demonstrated by the existing test case ["lzCompose: successful deposit and send on canto"](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/test/ASDRouter.js#L276-L297).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Immediate, but not a satisfying fix: Restrict the [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) method to trusted/whitelisted executors.

Alternative: Design change by directly implementing [`_lzReceive`(...)](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview#implementing-\_lzreceive) (building an `OApp`) such that a composed message is not needed anymore.

# Medium Risk Findings (3)
## [[M-01] `asdRouter.sol` is at risk of DOS due to vulnerable implementation of `NOTE` address](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/13)
*Submitted by [oakcobalt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/13)*

### Proof of Concept

Based on Canto [doc](https://docs.canto.io/evm-development/dex-and-lending-market#note), `NOTE` address may be modified and redeployed:

> The `NOTE` smart contract may be modified and redeployed at a new address in the future. For this reason, DApps should use the `CToken.underlying()` view on the `cNOTE` contract to determine the address for `NOTE` instead of hardcoding it.

As stated in doc, Dapp should use `CToken.underlying()` to ensure that `NOTE` address used is always correct.

The problem is current implementation in `asdRouter.sol` will only initiate `noteAddress` at contract deployment. `noteAddress` can not be changed afterward and the effect is the same as hardcoding an address.

```solidity
//contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol
    constructor(address _noteAddress, uint32 _cantoLzEID, address _crocSwapAddress, address _crocImpactAddress, address _asdUSDCAddress) {
        //@audit No method to change noteAddress after deployment.
|>      noteAddress = _noteAddress;
        cantoLzEID = _cantoLzEID;
        crocSwapAddress = _crocSwapAddress;
        crocImpactAddress = _crocImpactAddress;
        asdUSDC = _asdUSDCAddress;
    }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/52dd3d7083ca9bed0484180f4a5f3af84a10a9bc/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L45>

Note: When performing swap from `asdUSDC` to `NOTE`, `noteAddress` will be used instead of `CToken.underlying()`. This means when `NOTE` address changes, `swap` and `lzcompose` will be DOSed.

```solidity
//contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol
    function _swapOFTForNote(address _oftAddress, uint _amount, uint _minAmountNote) internal returns (uint, bool) {
...
        if (_oftAddress < noteAddress) {
            baseToken = _oftAddress;
|>          quoteToken = noteAddress;
        } else {
|>          baseToken = noteAddress;
            quoteToken = _oftAddress;
        }
...
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/52dd3d7083ca9bed0484180f4a5f3af84a10a9bc/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L214-L218>

For comparison, `asdOFT.sol` has the [correct `NOTE` address implementation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/52dd3d7083ca9bed0484180f4a5f3af84a10a9bc/contracts/asd/asdOFT.sol#L53) where `cNoteToken.underlying()` is used.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to store `cNote` address and only use `CNote.underlying()`.

## [[M-02] `ASDRouter` didn't call `ASDUSDC.approve()` to to grant permission for `crocSwapAddress` to spend their `ASDUSDC`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/7)
*Submitted by [0xpiken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/7), also found by [SpicyMeatball](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/4)*

The function 'ASDRouter#lzCompose()' never succeeds. The receiver can only receive `ASDUSDC` token when the call of 'ASDRouter#lzCompose()' is done.

### Proof of Concept

'ASDRouter#lzCompose()' is used to deposit wrapped USDC token for ASD token:

1. Once wrapped USDC is received, it will be deposited for `ASDUSDC` by calling [`ASDUSDC.deposit()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/main/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L87).
2. Next `ASDUSDC` will swapped to `NOTE` by calling [`_swapOFTForNote()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/main/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L90).
3. In the last, all `NOTE` will be deposited into ASD vault for ASD token by calling [`_depositNoteToASDVault()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/main/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L100).

However, in the second step, `ASDUSDC.approve()` was not invoked to authorize `crocSwapAddress` to spend their `ASDUSDC`. Consequently, `crocSwapAddress#swap()` cannot successfully swap `ASDUSDC` for `NOTE`. `_swapOFTForNote()` will fail and all `ASDUSDC` will be refunded to the designated receiver.

To demonstrate the aforementioned issue, the POC is divided into two parts:

1. The allowance that `crocSwapAddress` is allowed to spend from `ASDRouter` is `0`. Modify [`asdRouter.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/main/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol) as below:

```diff
...
import {ASDUSDC} from "./asdUSDC.sol";
+import {console} from "hardhat/console.sol";
...
    function _swapOFTForNote(address _oftAddress, uint _amount, uint _minAmountNote) internal returns (uint, bool) {
         ...
+        console.log("balance:", ASDUSDC(asdUSDC).balanceOf(address(this)));
+        console.log("allowance:", ASDUSDC(asdUSDC).allowance(address(this), crocSwapAddress));
        // swap is good to make, use call just in case revert occurs
        (bool successSwap, bytes memory data) = crocSwapAddress.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(ICrocSwapDex.swap.selector, baseToken, quoteToken, ambientPoolIdx, !isNoteBase, !isNoteBase, amountConverted, 0, 0, uintMinAmount, 0));
...
```

Run `npx hardhat test`. From the log we can see that the allowance is `0`, while the `ASDUSDC` balance of `ASDRouter` is not:

```

2. [`crocSwapAddress#swap()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/main/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L247) wouldn't work if the caller didn't approve `crocSwapAddress` to spend their token. Add fork configuration into [`hardhat.config.js`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/main/hardhat.config.js):

```diff
...
    networks: {
+       hardhat: {

+             url: "https://canto-rpc.ansybl.io/",

+           },
+           chainId: 7700,

```

Create `test/DEX.js`:

```solidity

const hre = require("hardhat");

describe("Dex", function () {

        dex  = await hre.ethers.getContractAt("ICrocSwapDex", dexAddress);
        usdc = await hre.ethers.getContractAt("IERC20", usdcAddress);
        cNote = await hre.ethers.getContractAt("CErc20Interface", cNoteAddress);
    });

    it("User can only call DEX.swap() for cNote after call USDC.approve(dex)", async () => {

            params: [usdcWhaleAddress],
        });
        whale = await ethers.getSigner(usdcWhaleAddress);
        let usdcBalanceBeforeSwap = await usdc.balanceOf(usdcWhaleAddress);
        await usdc.connect(whale).approve(dexAddress, 0);
        expect(await usdc.allowance(usdcWhaleAddress,dexAddress)).to.be.equal(0);
        //@audit-info swap failed due to zero allowance
        expect(dex.connect(whale).swap(
            usdcAddress,
            cNoteAddress,
            36000,

        let usedUSDC = usdcBalanceBeforeSwap - usdcBalanceAfterSwap;
        //@audit-info swap succeeded and 2000000 of USDC was tranferred from user
        expect(usedUSDC).to.be.equal(2000000);
    });
});
```

Open one terminal to run `npx hardhat node`, then open another terminal to run `npx hardhat test`. It's obvious that `dex.swap()` will fail if `usdc.approve()` is not called first.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Set `allowance` to the maximum value from the beginning:

```diff
    constructor(address _noteAddress, uint32 _cantoLzEID, address _crocSwapAddress, address _crocImpactAddress, address _asdUSDCAddress) {
        noteAddress = _noteAddress;
        cantoLzEID = _cantoLzEID;
        crocSwapAddress = _crocSwapAddress;
        crocImpactAddress = _crocImpactAddress;
        asdUSDC = _asdUSDCAddress;
+       ASDUSDC(asdUSDC).approve(crocSwapAddress, type(uint).max);
    }
```

## [[M-03] Removing token from the whitelist may cause DoS due to limited USDC amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/3)
*Submitted by [SpicyMeatball](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/3), also found by [0xTheC0der](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/30) and [oakcobalt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/15)*

Users won't be able to withdraw `USDC` tokens from `asdUSDC`.

### Proof of Concept

Consider a situation where we have two whitelisted `USDC` versions 1 and 2:

```
    usdcBalances[usdc1] = 1000
    usdcBalances[usdc2] = 500
    asdUSDC total supply = 1500
```

After some time, `asdUSDC` owner removes `usdc2` from the whitelist. It creates a situation where `1500` `asdUSDC` is only backed by `1000` `usdc1` tokens, since it's no longer possible to withdraw `usdc2`. 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/main/contracts/asd/asdUSDC.sol#L52>

```solidity
    function withdraw(address _usdcVersion, uint256 _amount) external returns (uint256) {
        // check whitelist
>>      require(whitelistedUSDCVersions[_usdcVersion], "ASDUSDC: USDC version not whitelisted");
        // burn tokens
        _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
        // calculate amount to withdraw
        uint256 amountToWithdraw = _amount / (10 ** (this.decimals() - ERC20(_usdcVersion).decimals()));
        // check balance
        require(usdcBalances[_usdcVersion] >= amountToWithdraw, "ASDUSDC: Not enough USDC balance");
        // transfer USDC
        usdcBalances[_usdcVersion] -= amountToWithdraw;
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(ERC20(_usdcVersion), msg.sender, amountToWithdraw);
        emit Withdrawal(_usdcVersion, amountToWithdraw);
        return amountToWithdraw;
    }
```

If former `usdc2` holders withdraw their `500` `asdUSDC` for `usdc1`, there will be no `usdc1` left for other users.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider removing the require block from `withdraw` function.

```diff
- require(whitelistedUSDCVersions[_usdcVersion], "ASDUSDC: USDC version not whitelisted");
```

# Low Risk and Non-Critical Issues

For this audit, 5 reports were submitted by wardens detailing low risk and non-critical issues. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/9) by **0xTheC0der** received the top score from the judge.

*The following wardens also submitted reports: [oakcobalt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/17), [d3e4](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/22), [0xpiken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/8), and [SpicyMeatball](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/2).*

## [L-01] Use of `transfer(...)` for native gas token transfers is not future-proof

See [`_refundToken`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L184) method:

```solidity
function _refundToken(bytes32 _guid, address _tokenAddress, address _refundAddress, uint _amount, uint _nativeAmount, string memory _reason) internal {
    ...
    // transfer native tokens to refund address and check that this value is less than or equal to msg.value
    if (_nativeAmount > 0 && _nativeAmount <= msg.value) {
        payable(_refundAddress).transfer(_nativeAmount);   // @audit use of transfer
    }
}
```

The `transfer(...)` function forwards a fixed amount of 2300 gas. Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs. For example, EIP 1884 broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction. [See here](https://solodit.xyz/checklist).

### Recommendation

Use `call(...)` to prevent potential gas issues.

## [L-02] Use of `transfer(...)` for native gas token transfers can lead to `lzCompose(...)` revert

See [`_refundToken`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L184) method:

```solidity
function _refundToken(bytes32 _guid, address _tokenAddress, address _refundAddress, uint _amount, uint _nativeAmount, string memory _reason) internal {
    ...
    // transfer native tokens to refund address and check that this value is less than or equal to msg.value
    if (_nativeAmount > 0 && _nativeAmount <= msg.value) {
        payable(_refundAddress).transfer(_nativeAmount);   // @audit throws error
    }
}
```

In case the `_refundAddress` is a contract (it's not documented that it cannot be a contract), the transfer might revert (out of gas, cannot accept native token, logic error, etc.) which leads to OFTs being temporarily stuck in the contract. 

See also "Attack ideas" in [README](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto?tab=readme-ov-file#attack-ideas-where-to-focus-for-bugs):
> Since Layer Zero executors call `lzCompose` after sending funds to the `ASDRouter` contract, this `lzCompose` function should never revert.

### Recommendation

Use `call(...)` instead and check the `success` return value. If it returns `false`, wrap the native gas tokens into an ERC-20 (see also `WETH`) and transfer them to the `_refundAddress`.

## [L-03] Precision loss in `withdraw(...)` can lead to all `asdUDSC` being burned while not all `USDC` is withdrawn

See [`withdraw`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdUSDC.sol#L52-L66) method:  

```solidity
function withdraw(address _usdcVersion, uint256 _amount) external returns (uint256) {
    // check whitelist
    require(whitelistedUSDCVersions[_usdcVersion], "ASDUSDC: USDC version not whitelisted");
    // burn tokens
    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    // calculate amount to withdraw
    uint256 amountToWithdraw = _amount / (10 ** (this.decimals() - ERC20(_usdcVersion).decimals()));   // @audit precision loss
    // check balance
    require(usdcBalances[_usdcVersion] >= amountToWithdraw, "ASDUSDC: Not enough USDC balance");
    // transfer USDC
    usdcBalances[_usdcVersion] -= amountToWithdraw;
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(ERC20(_usdcVersion), msg.sender, amountToWithdraw);
    emit Withdrawal(_usdcVersion, amountToWithdraw);
    return amountToWithdraw;
}
```

The `asdUDSC` token has 18 decimals. For example, if the `USDC` token has 6 decimals (see [ERC20 token behaviors in scope](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto?tab=readme-ov-file#erc20-token-behaviors-in-scope)), the burned `_amount` gets divided by `10**12` leading to a precision loss in the resulting `amountToWithdraw`.

### Proof of Concept

The following test case, which should deposit and withdraw with differing decimals, demonstrates how all `asdUDSC` is burned while not all `USDC4` (with 6 decimals) is withdrawn:

### Recommendation

Re-calculate the actual `_amount` to burn by upscaling from `amountToWithdraw` to avoid burning more than what is actually withdrawn.

## [L-04] The `asdUSDC` contract insufficiently supports `USDC` tokens with more than 18 decimals, resulting in a DoS scenario

Instances: [`deposit`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdUSDC.sol#L40), [`withdraw`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdUSDC.sol#L58), [`recover`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdUSDC.sol#L78).

```solidity
...
uint256 amountTo... = _amount * (10 ** (this.decimals() - ERC20(_usdcVersion).decimals()));
...
```

The `asdUDSC` token has 18 decimals. In case of a `USDC` token having more than 18 decimals (see [ERC20 token behaviors in scope](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto?tab=readme-ov-file#erc20-token-behaviors-in-scope)), the code above will revert due to an "arithmetic underflow" error (of `uint8`), which effectively causes DoS of the `asdUSDC` contract for such tokens.

### Recommendation 

Also covers the case when `ERC20(_usdcVersion).decimals() > 18`:

```solidity
...
if (this.decimals() >= ERC20(_usdcVersion).decimals()) {
    amountTo... = _amount * (10 ** (this.decimals() - ERC20(_usdcVersion).decimals()));
}
else {
    amountTo... = _amount / (10 ** (ERC20(_usdcVersion).decimals() - this.decimals()));
}
...
```

## [L-05] The `asdUSDC` contract can be used as a free DEX

Due to the permissionless and feeless nature of the [`deposit`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdUSDC.sol#L34-L44) and [`withdraw`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdUSDC.sol#L52-L66) methods, everyone can use them to swap whitelisted USDC-like tokens for free. This might be especially attractive (for arbitraging) if such a stablecoin slightly depegs.  

### Consequence

Users cannot expect to be able to withdraw the same stablecoin they've deposited since its underlying balance might be depleted.

### Recommendation

Restrict the [`deposit`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdUSDC.sol#L34-L44) method to only be callable from the `asdRouter` contract.

## [L-06] The `asdUSDC` owner can block withdrawals by removing a token from the whitelist

See [`withdraw`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdUSDC.sol#L52-L66):

```solidity
function withdraw(address _usdcVersion, uint256 _amount) external returns (uint256) {
    // check whitelist
    require(whitelistedUSDCVersions[_usdcVersion], "ASDUSDC: USDC version not whitelisted");  // @audit owner can block withdrawals
    // burn tokens
    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    // calculate amount to withdraw
    uint256 amountToWithdraw = _amount / (10 ** (this.decimals() - ERC20(_usdcVersion).decimals()));
    // check balance
    require(usdcBalances[_usdcVersion] >= amountToWithdraw, "ASDUSDC: Not enough USDC balance");
    // transfer USDC
    usdcBalances[_usdcVersion] -= amountToWithdraw;
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(ERC20(_usdcVersion), msg.sender, amountToWithdraw);
    emit Withdrawal(_usdcVersion, amountToWithdraw);
    return amountToWithdraw;
}
```

If the owner of `asdUSDC` decides to stop supporting an USDC-like token and therefore, proceeds to remove it from the whitelist, withdrawals will also be disabled leading to locked user value.

### Recommendation

Remove the whitelist check from the [`withdraw`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdUSDC.sol#L52-L66) method; it's sufficient to enforce it within [`deposit`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdUSDC.sol#L34-L44). Therefore, once deposited, USDC-like tokens can always be withdrawn.

## [L-07] Fixed execution gas amount might not work for all potential target chains

In [`_sendASD`(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L151-L152), when `asD` is transferred to another chain via LayerZero, a fixed gas amount (in native tokens of the source chain, see also [documentation](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/gas-settings/options#lzreceive-option)) of `200000` is provided for the execution of `lzReceive(...)` (on the destination chain).

```solidity
// create send params for the Layer Zero oapp
bytes memory sendOptions = OptionsBuilder.addExecutorLzReceiveOption(OptionsBuilder.newOptions(), 200000, 0);
```

At the time of writing, `200000 canto * 0.258 $CANTO = 5.16e-11 $` which might be insufficient to cover the gas fees for the execution of `lzReceive(...)` on most destination chains.

### Recommendation

Compute this value according to the destination chain or let the user specify it similar to `_payload._feeForSend`. Also, the [quoting mechanism](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/gas-settings/tx-pricing#quote-mechanism) can help with that.

# Audit Analysis

For this audit, 1 analysis report was submitted by wardens. An analysis report examines the codebase as a whole, providing observations and advice on such topics as architecture, mechanism, or approach. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/27) by **oakcobalt** received the top score from the judge.

## Summary

`asD` enables protocols to earn yield on user dollar deposits, always pegged to 1 `$NOTE`. Depositing `$NOTE` into the Canto Lending Market accrues interest. This version of `asD` utilizes LayerZero's Omnichain Fungible Token, enabling creators from any LayerZero supported chain to earn extra revenue from stable coin deposits.

### Existing standards

ERC20 token (including fee-on-transfer, low/high decimal behaviors).

## Approach:

- Scope: `CTokenInterfaces.sol`, `Turnstile.sol`, `asdOFT.sol`, `asdRouter.sol`, `asdUSDC.sol`, `CrocInterfaces.sol`. (3 interfaces + 3 contracts). My focus is on the three contracts.
- Roles: Role-specific flows are focused including `onlyOwner` flows, user flows and executor flows.
- Layer zero protocol: layer zero related OFT features are evaluated as context to analyze any vulnerable implementations in scope.

## Centralization Risks

Here's an analysis of potential centralization risks in the provided contracts:

### `asdOFT.sol`

As intended design, only owner of the contract can withdraw yield from `CToken` contract. Regular users are not able to claim yield.

Overall low centralization risk.

### `asdRouter.sol`

Although the contract has owner, low centralization risks - due to main logics and public-facing functions are not under the owner's control (no `onlyOwner` modifier and no centralized parameters).

### `asdUSDC.sol`

Higher centralization risk due to the USDC whitelisting and delisting features through `updateWhitelist`.

## Systemic Risks

### `CToken` liquidation risk

`asdOFT.sol` relies on minting and redeeming on `CNOTE` token. `CToken` is essentially a lending/borrow market with inherent liquidation risks. Although low risk for depositors, it's possible that any case of liquidation failure during extreme market conditions or other factors, depositors cannot fully redeem their funds. This will affect `ASD` holders.

```solidity
//contracts/asd/asdOFT.sol
    function mint(uint256 _amount) external {
...
        uint256 returnCode = cNoteToken.mint(_amount); 
...
    }
    function burn(uint256 _amount) external {
...
      uint256 returnCode = cNoteToken.redeemUnderlying(_amount); // Request _amount of NOTE (the underlying of cNOTE) 
...
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/52dd3d7083ca9bed0484180f4a5f3af84a10a9bc/contracts/asd/asdOFT.sol#L38-L57

### `CrocSwapDex` market risk

`asdRouter.sol` relies on `CrocSwapDex` market to swap `USDC` for `NOTE`. Like any dex, market volatility might cause price ratio changes or other unexpected market pause or failures which will impact the `lzCompose` tx, causing tx fail. Although refunds will be issued for users, any upfront fees user on the source chain might have paid will be lost.

```solidity
//contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol
    function _swapOFTForNote(address _oftAddress, uint _amount, uint _minAmountNote) internal returns (uint, bool) {
...
        // swap is good to make, use call just in case revert occurs
        (bool successSwap, bytes memory data) = crocSwapAddress.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(ICrocSwapDex.swap.selector, baseToken, quoteToken, ambientPoolIdx, !isNoteBase, !isNoteBase, amountConverted, 0, 0, uintMinAmount, 0));
...
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/52dd3d7083ca9bed0484180f4a5f3af84a10a9bc/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L247

## Mechanism Review

### Swapping implementation

In `asdRouter.sol`, swapping `asdUSDC` for `NOTE` will be performed for every `lzCompose`. Current swapping implementation might be wasteful in that it performs extra steps to check `baseToken`, `quoteToken`, sorting, and verifying pool address even though the token and pool should have already been known in contract deployment.

```solidity
//contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol
    function _swapOFTForNote(address _oftAddress, uint _amount, uint _minAmountNote) internal returns (uint, bool) {
        // sort tokens
        address baseToken;
        address quoteToken;
        if (_oftAddress < noteAddress) {
            baseToken = _oftAddress;
            quoteToken = noteAddress;
        } else {
            baseToken = noteAddress;
            quoteToken = _oftAddress;
        }
        // check if pool exists
        //@audit-info note: in the context of lzCompose, baseToken and quoteToken will always be asdUSDC and $NOTE
        if (ambientPoolFor(baseToken, quoteToken, ambientPoolIdx) == 0) {
            // nothing swapped, swapped failed
            return (0, false);
        }
...
        bool isNoteBase = baseToken == noteAddress;
...
        if (isNoteBase && -baseFlow < minAmountInt) {
            // nothing swapped, swapped failed
            return (0, false);
        } else if (!isNoteBase && -quoteFlow < minAmountInt) {
            // nothing swapped, swapped failed
            return (0, false);
        }
...
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/52dd3d7083ca9bed0484180f4a5f3af84a10a9bc/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L209

### Recommendations

The above checking, sorting base and `quoteToken` address and the if control flows might be redundant, given that base and `quoteToken` are fixed tokens, and their pool address should have been known at contract deployment. Consider refactoring swapping to allow token sorting and pool checking to be done at contract deployment. This will reduce runtime gas cost as well.

## Conclusions

The report evaluates potential centralization risks within the provided contracts; noting low risks in `asdOFT.sol` and `asdRouter.sol`, while highlighting higher risks in `asdUSDC.sol` due to `USDC` whitelisting and delisting features. Furthermore, systemic risks such as `CToken` liquidation risk and market risks associated with `CrocSwapDex` are analyzed, underscoring potential implications for depositors and users. Mechanism reviews pinpoint areas for optimization, particularly in the swapping implementation of `asdRouter.sol`, suggesting refactoring to enhance efficiency and reduce runtime gas costs.

Overall, the report provides valuable insights into the protocol's functionality, associated risks, and opportunities for improvement, laying a foundation for informed decision-making and potential protocol enhancements.
